I've recently been reading Chad Fowler's The Passionate Programmer, and it's one of the best programming books I've read. With no code examples you might wonder whether this is in fact a programming book, but I think that's why it's so good. 

Instead of only approaching Ruby or any other language it addresses some common problems that meets all programmers both freelance and employee.

One thing I'm taking from it is, <h2>PROGRAMMERS SUCK AT MARKETING THEMSELVES</h2>.
